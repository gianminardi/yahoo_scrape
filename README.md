Allows the user to find financial info about companies in a quick and efficient manner


Project was made in May 2021. 
Current system allows the user to do 3 things:
1) enter specific company names into the command line interface (can be 1 can
be 100). 
We then scrape each company's symbol, current stock price, open price, PE
ratio, Market Cap, shares outstanding, total assets, total liabilities, total debt,
tangible book value, and book value per share. 
With this information determine if a stock is worth buying/investigating by looking at the book value per share compared
to the current stock price Send that info to a nice csv file. User can quickly open
excel file and see which one is worth investigating according to ‘buy’ metric.
2)Scrape the info from all fortune 500 companies. 
We then scrape each of the 500’s company’s info (just like at 1) and send info to a nice csv file. User can quickly
open excel file and see which one is worth investigating according to ‘buy’ metric.
3) Scrape info from all 6000+ companies we have access to. We then scrape
each of the 6000+ company’s info (just like at 1) and send info to a nice csv file. User
can quickly open excel file and see which one is worth investigating according to
‘buy’ metric
